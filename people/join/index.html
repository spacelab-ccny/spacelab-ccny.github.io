        <p>Thanks for your interest in joining the Spacelab! Below is a guide on
            how to join us as a research assistant. This page has information for
            prospective PhD students, current City College and CUNY students,
            prospective City College students, and high school students. Before you
            send <a href="https://tjo.is">me</a> an email about opportunities,
            please read through this page to understand what positions are available
            and the application process. I have made
            this information available here to increase transparency. </p>
        <h2 id="prospective-phd-students">Prospective PhD Students</h2>
        <p><strong>I am actively recruiting PhD students to start in Spring 2026 and Fall
                2026!</strong></p>
        <p>So, you want to do a PhD. It is an exciting time to be a researcher,
            and there are plenty of open problems to investigate – great choice! The
            next decision you have to make is choosing an advisor for your PhD. To
            help you make this decision, I have collected some thoughts on working
            under my mentorship in the Spacelab.</p>
        <p>You would probably be a good fit for our group if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>You are interested in computer security, privacy, and/or
                    applied cryptography</strong>. The overall trajectory for the Spacelab
                is building <em>practical cryptographic systems</em>, i.e., efficient,
                deployable computer systems that provide security and privacy guarantees
                through the use of cryptography. I am particularly interested in
                problems that impact everyday people, and these interests are reflected
                in <a href="https://tjo.is/#publications">my publications</a>. My
                research area and background are more aligned with computer science and
                engineering, and so I would not be as helpful a mentor for the other
                disciplines (e.g., electronics, power systems, photonics) in our
                department.</li>
            <li><strong>You believe in the power of security, privacy, and applied
                    cryptography to achieve social good</strong>. As academics, I believe we have a
                responsibility to achieve positive impacts on society through our work. I tend to agree with
                Phillip Rogaway’s statement that cryptography is “<a
                    href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/moral-fn.pdf">an
                    inherently political tool</a>”.
                This worldview influences the types of questions I like to answer;
                typically, these involve designing technical solutions within real-world
                societal contexts, and that requires confronting social ills such as
                surveillance, censorship, and exploitation.</li>
            <li><strong>You prefer a hands-on mentorship style</strong>. As an
                early-career faculty member, I am very active in research projects and
                coming up with new ideas. I try to keep the Spacelab to a manageable
                size so I can give my students personal attention and mentorship. I will
                work on projects closely alongside you, and will be regularly available
                if you need my help.</li>
            <li><strong>You like to collaborate with other people</strong>. I
                believe that teamwork is a requirement to be successful in the
                field. The questions we think about require expertise from networks,
                hardware, machine learning, theory, sociology, and beyond. Projects in
                the Spacelab typically consist of several people – a combination of
                students and faculty from different institutions.</li>
            <li><strong>You want a full-time, funded position</strong>. My PhD
                students will have full tuition support as well as a stipend for living
                expenses each year. There are also opportunities for summer internships
                and research exchanges at other universities.</li>
            <li><strong>You want to live and work in New York City</strong>. City
                College is located in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, and is
                well connected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway">the greatest
                    public transit system in America</a> to all that New York City has to
                offer: world-class <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Michelin-starred_restaurants_in_New_York_City">food</a>,
                <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_museums_and_cultural_institutions_in_New_York_City">arts</a>,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Avenue">shopping</a>, and
                (occasionally) <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_in_the_New_York_metropolitan_area">sports</a>.
                Also, being in New York allows you to easily collaborate with and even
                <a
                    href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/news/grove-school-engineering-joins-doctoral-degrees-without-borders-program">take
                    classes at</a> the other universities in the area.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Take some time to think about these criteria. I see my PhD students
            as <em>collaborators</em>, and while there are hierarchies inherent to
            academia, it is important to me that the whole group has a good working
            relationship. Even if you and I might not be a good fit, I would
            encourage you to reach out to one of my excellent colleagues at <a
                href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/people?name=&amp;category=All&amp;term_node_tid_depth=16345&amp;term_node_tid_depth_1=84&amp;group=&amp;cat=All&amp;school=21&amp;dept=84">City
                College</a> or the <a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/computer-science/faculty-and-committees">CUNY
                Graduate Center</a> instead!</p>
        <p>After reading all of this, if you think you’d like to work
            with me, send me an email with the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The subject line “Prospective Spacelab Crewmate”.</li>
            <li>A copy of your resume and transcript(s).</li>
            <li>A paragraph describing your research interests.</li>
            <li>A paragraph describing why you think we would be a good fit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before you email me, also consider taking a look at David Evans’s <a
                href="https://uvasrg.github.io/prospective/">advice on how prospective
                students should contact advisors</a>.</p>
        <p>If there is potential, we can find time to chat and discuss more.
            Then, you can <a href="https://welcome.ccny.cuny.edu/apply/">apply to the PhD
                program at City College</a>, with me as a prospective advisor, before
            the deadline. I would highly recommend that you include in your statement
            why you think you and I would be a good fit.</p>
        <h2 id="current-students">Current students</h2>

            independent study credit for your research work.</p>
        <h2 id="prospective-masters-and-undergraduate-students">Prospective
            master’s and undergraduate students</h2>
        <p>Applications to our master’s and undergraduate program are handled at
            the college level; I do not have control over this process. Due to a
            high volume of emails, you may not get a response to inquiries as a
            prospective master’s or undergraduate student. Instead, take a look at
            the <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/admissions">City College

        <h2 id="high-school-students">High school students</h2>
        <p>I currently do not offer any opportunities for high school students.
            Due to a high volume of emails, you may not get a response to inquiries
            as a high school student. I will update this page if any become
            available.</p>
