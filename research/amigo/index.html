        <p> Protests are an important tool in the fight against authoritarian governments. Through protests, ordinary
            citizens
            can voice their opinions and bring visibility to their concerns. Often times both the success of a protest
            and the safety
            of those involved is heavily influenced by <a
                href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2019/08/be-water-seven-tactics-that-are-winning-hong-kongs-democracy-revolution-2">on-the-ground
                communication</a>.
            Using tools like <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a>, <a
                href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a>, protesters can
            collectively decide where and when to hold demonstrations, and how to respond to real-time events, like the
            arrival of police. This communication is especially
            important in the <i>large-scale</i> protest settings we consider where hundreds or thousands of people may
            be participating in densely crowded areas.
            Because of the importance of communication, authoritarian regimes are <a
                href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/13/tech/telegram-ddos-attack-hong-kong-china">highly motivated</a> to
            intercept and/or disrupt communication channels during protests.
        </p>
        <h2>Censorship Tactics</h2>
        <p> If an authoritarian regime wants to stifle activism, one obvious way is to shut down demonstrations before
            they happen. This may
            require eavesdropping on communication between protesters. One way this can be achieved is through <a
                href="https://sls.eff.org/technologies/cell-site-simulators-imsi-catchers">cell-site simulators</a>;
            tools that emulate
            cell towers and enable downgrade attacks that force connected phones to use unsafe or unencrypted
            communication protocols.
        </p>
        <p> Another strategy is for an authoritarian regime to force an Internet shutdown. Internet shutdowns are
            periods of degraded
            or completely restricted access to content on the Internet. In these situations, protesters can no longer
            use applications like
            Signal and WhatsApp, since they rely on Internet connectivity. While an intentional Internet shutdown may
            seem extreme, as of 2023
            there were a reported total of <a
                href="https://www.accessnow.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2023-KIO-Report.pdf">283 shutdowns across the
                globe</a>. Aside from full Internet shutdowns, authoritarian
            regimes have also been known to conduct <a
                href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/13/tech/telegram-ddos-attack-hong-kong-china">targeted
                Denial-of-Service attacks</a> against popular communication infrastructure.

        <br>
        <h2>Amigo: Mesh Messaging For the Protest Setting</h2>
        <p>
            Since protesters cannot rely on Internet-based messaging during Internet shutdowns, mesh-based communication
            is a viable option. In a mesh network, communication is done in a peer-to-peer nature; individuals directly
            communicate
            with each other using the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth capabilities of their phone. In fact, this idea isn't new. If
            you've ever used Airdrop, you've participated in peer-to-peer
            communication over Bluetooth Low Energy! There are various applications, like <a
                href="https://bridgefy.me/">Bridgefy</a> and <a href="https://briarproject.org/">Briar</a>, that
            are designed for peer-to-peer communication. The problem, however, is that requirements for mesh-based
            communication tools for the general use
            setting do not align with the requirements for the large-scale Internet shutdown protest setting.
        </p>
        <img src="../../images/amigo/Mesh.png" class="blog-image">
        <p>Based on a study by <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21-albrecht.pdf">Albrecht et al.</a>, a
            suitable communication tool for protesters during Internet shutdowns needs to informed by the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Protest communication occurs primarily in group chats.</li>
            <li>Groups must be able to securely add members as a protest unfolds.</li>
            <li>Groups must be able to remove members.</li>
            <li>Communications should be possible during an Internet shutdown.</li>
            <li>Communication should be anonymous.</li>
        </ol>

        <p> While prior research works and tools like Briar and Bridgefy exist, they do not adequately address the above
            requirements.
            Unfortunately, this means in real-life scenarios protesters are resigned to using tools that put their
            safety at risk. As an example, consider the <a
                href="https://www.hrw.org/blog-feed/hong-kong-protests">widespread 2019–2020 protests</a>
            in Hong Kong. The protests erupted in response to the government’s attempt to pass the Extradition Law
            Amendment Bill (ELAB). The bill would have allowed Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China;
            many Hong Kong citizens feared that the bill would further erode Hong Kong’s legal independence from China.
            This protest was marked
            by <a
                href="https://qz.com/1642423/telegram-hit-by-china-linked-ddos-attack-during-hong-kong-protests">partial
                Internet blackouts</a>, during which many protesters attempted to use Bridgefy. Bridgefy has been shown
            to not only fail to provide
            anonymity, but also message confidentiality. In addition, protesters reported that the tool simply was not
            able to handle
            the network load induced by the large number of protesters.
        </p>

        <p> In short, protesters require a tool that is designed specifically for the protest setting. A tool that
            safeguards the <i>confidentiality</i> of messages,
            and the <i>anonymity</i> of participants. A tool that is oriented towards <i>group communication</i> and can
            be relied upon in large-scale protest environments
            that are marked by densely-packed people and <i>protest-specific movement patterns</i> that give rise to
            <i>challenging network environments</i>. Communication needs to happen even when the Internet is
            unavailable.
            We designed <b>Amigo</b> with these goals in mind.
        </p>

        <h2>Designing Amigo</h2>
        <p>
            Now that we have the proper background, let's get into the specifics of Amigo's design. We can break
            Amigo into individual layers, each layer playing a key role in providing protesters with secure and
            effective
            ways of communicating. The system design figure below has a lot of information, so we provide a brief
            summary of each layer.
        </p>
        <img src="../../images/amigo/SysDesign.jpeg" class="blog-image">
        <h3>Application Layer</h3>
        <p> At the application layer, users can take direct actions like creating groups, adding group members, and
            sending messages.
            These actions map to capabilities that a user would interact with when directly using the application's
            interface.
            Behind the scenes these actions, like sending messages, are protected by keys negotiated at the session
            layer
        </p>
        <h3>Session Layer</h3>
        <p> At the session layer, Amigo implements an efficient Continuous Group Key Agreement protocol, or CGKA for
            short. We'll get introduce
            the specifics of this CGKA later, but at a high level it enables a way for group members to mutually derive
            key material used to keep their communication confidential.
        </p>
        <h3>Routing Layer</h3>
        <p> The session layer sends and receives user-generated messages and CGKA-generated
            messages via the routing layer. Amigo is compatible with traditional flooding approaches, but we notably
            propose
            a novel <i>dynamic clique routing</i> approach tailored for the protest scenarios we consider. We'll get
            intro
            the specifics of this protocol as well.
        </p>
        <h3>Link Layer</h3>
        <p>At the bottom of the Amigo stack is the link layer. Amigo can utilize technologies like Wi-Fi and BLE for
            peer-to-peer communication.</p>

        <h2>Secure and Anonymous Group Messaging</h2>
        <p>
            Protesters require secure and anonymous group communication. This means that (1) their communication should
            remain
            <i>confidential</i> to group outsiders and (2) their communication should remain <i>anonymous to group
                outsiders</i>. One way that
            communication tools provide the former property is through end-to-end encryption. Tools like Signal allow
            two users to
            <a href=https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/">establish a pairwise key</a> - a single key
            that both users utilize to encrypt their messages.
        </p>

        <p>
            While this is fine when communicating between pairs of individuals, it quickly becomes inefficient when
            operating in group communication settings.
            Sending a single message to a group of individuals using a pairwise approach means sending the same message
            encrypted under each key that you
            share with each individual. This inefficiency is the primary motivation for continuous group key agreement
            protocols; these protocols allow groups
            to efficiently derive and rotate a shared key. Effiency is realized through a <i>ratchet tree</i>, a data
            structure that organizes group
            members and key material in a binary tree. In a ratchet tree, group members occupy leaf node positions,
            while intermedate nodes along with the root
            are associated solely with key material.
            Below is what a group's ratchet tree with one initial member might look like for Amigo's CGKA.
        </p>
        <img src="../../images/amigo/NewGroup.png" class="blog-image">

        <p>
            Below is what Amigo's CGKA might look like with two individuals, after a member is added and is occupying
            <i>Node<sub>1</sub></i>. Without diving into the weeds, <i>Gen()</i> is used to derive updating key material
            given a seed, <i>&Delta;</i>.
            <i>Node<sub>1</sub></i>, after they join the group, generates updating key material and uses the ⭐ operator
            to apply this new cryptographic state on the old. This star operator is what makes Amigo uniquely suited to
            the Internet-shutdown protest setting.
        </p>
        <!-- <p> Now let's get into the details by exploring a concrete example, adding members.  In Amigo's CGKA, adding members is as simple as placing a joining member in a leaf node within the tree, and having that newly joined member update the appropriate key material.
            This member then sends information on how to update the keys to the rest of the group, so everyone can have a consistent view of the group's ratchet tree. Let us consider the below figure.  A new member, is invited
            to the group and occupies the leaf position of <i>Node<sub>1</sub></i>.  <i>Node<sub>1</sub></i> runs <i>Gen(&Delta;)</i> where <i>Gen()</i> is the generation algorithmn for our public key scheme and <i>&Delta;</i> is a random seed.  This key generation is done for
            every node along the path of <i>Node<sub>1</sub></i> up to and including the root.  The newly generated keys are used by <i>Node<sub>1</sub></i> to update key material using the ⭐ operator (we'll go into that shortly).  The seeds used to generate the updating material are then encrypted by <i>Node<sub>1</sub></i> under their associated node's prior public key (since only a node's descendants should have that node's secret key) and 
            sent to the rest of the group.  Group members will decrypt the seeds intended for them, deriving secret keys they can use to update their own state.  <i>Node<sub>1</sub></i> also broadcasts the public keys they applied during their update since those are needed by everyone.
        </p> -->
        <img src="../../images/amigo/AddMember.png" class="blog-image">

        <p>
            While other CGKAs like <a href="https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/">MLS</a>, <a
                href="https://inria.hal.science/hal-02425247/file/treekem%20(1).pdf">TreeKEM</a>, and <a
                href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3243734.3243747">ART</a> are out there, they are primarily designed
            with a centralized infrastructure in mind,
            leveraging online servers to aid in the group key agreement process. These protocols require that changes to
            state held in the ratchet tree <i>(protocol messages)</i> be applied in the same order by everyone - a
            consistent global ordering.
            This ordering is easy to achieve with the help of a centralized server, but nontrivial during an
            Internet-shutdown and over a mesh where messages may arrive in any order.
        </p>
        </p>
        Amigo allows for a consistent ratchet tree state by leveraging the direction of <a
            href="https://mattweidner.com/assets/pdf/acs-dissertation.pdf">Causal TreeKEM</a>; instead of ratchet tree
        updates that <i>overwrite</i> state, we <i>combine</i>
        previous and existing state. In this way, we embrace the inconsistencies of the mesh network by enabling updates
        to be applied in any order. As long as group members recieves
        every state update, Amigo's CGKA will converge with eventual consistency and group members will derive
        consistent key material. <b>So, members can apply protocol
            messages regardless of the order. </b>We denote this combination operator using ⭐.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because we are working with elliptic curve cryptography, its relatively simple to combine key material. When
            working with
            elliptic curves, a public key <i>pk</i> is derived by multiplying a (secret) scalar <i>sk</i> with the
            curve's generator point <i>P</i>.
            Thus we can instantiate ⭐ as <i>sk<sub>x⭐y</sub> = sk<sub>x</sub> + sk<sub>y</sub>, pk<sub>x⭐y</sub> =
                (sk<sub>x</sub> + sk<sub>y</sub>) * P</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from enabling state synchronization within a mesh, Amigo provides end-to-end confidentiality by
            encrypting all messages sent within groups using keys contained within the ratchet tree. The keys used for a
            particular message correspond to
            the set of members who are the intended recipients. Via AES-GCM, encrypted messages are also authenticated.
            Amigo provides anonymity by not including any identifying
            metadata with messages. This means that clients utilize <i>trial decryption</i>; they attempt to decrypt
            every message they recieve in order to determine if it is
            intended for them or not. Last, but not least, Amigo provides <a
                href="https://signal.org/blog/asynchronous-security/">forward secrecy</a> and <a
                href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/#symmetric-key-ratchet">post-compromise
                security.</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Efficient and Effective Routing</h2>
        <p>
            So now that we have end-to-end encrypted, anonymous, and authenticated messaging, we need a ways
            to disseminate these messages. Within a protest area group members may be close together; in these scenarios
            directly exchanging a message via Wi-Fi or BLE is a viable approach. In the cases, however, where group
            members
            are farther apart messages need to be propogated through the mesh until they are recieved by their intended
            recipient.
        </p>
        <img src="../../images/amigo/RoutingProtocolsFlood.png" class="blog-image">
        <p>
            One common way of message propogation is via <i>epidemic flooding</i>. Simply put, an individual
            sends a message to everyone within vicinity. Recipients do the same with this message. Every message has a
            time-to-live (TTL), i.e., a
            maximum number of hops decremented each time the message is propogated. The idea is that once the TTL has
            reached zero, the
            message should have been recieved by the intended recipient. <a
                href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04145">Digest flooding</a> is similar, but with optimizations that
            attempt to limit the total number of messages network participants have to propogate.
        </p>

        <p>
            While flooding-based protocols often achieve high delivery rates, they are notorious for consuming a lot of
            bandwidth.
            Bandwidth is precious within a mesh network, particularly in large-scale densely populated protest
            environments
            where congested network environments can lead to dropped messages and ineffective communication.
        </p>

        <p>
            Clique-based routing provides a promising solution to the congestion problem. Instead of everyone
            propogating messages,
            a clique leader (a client within a limited geographic area) recieves messages from nearby protesters and
            propogates those
            messages to other clique leaders. Clique leaders also disseminate messages to those in their clique. In <a
                href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04145">static clique</a> routing,
            clique leaders and their respective followers never change. In reality, however, protesters move about and
            Amigo therefore
            proposes and implements a <i> novel Dynamic Clique routing protocol.</i>

        <img src="../../images/amigo/RoutingProtocolsClique.png" class="blog-image">
        <p>
            In our Dynamic Clique routing protocol, there are election periods where clients within proximity of each
            other form a clique and elect a clique leader.
            These clique leaders then propogate and disseminate messages for their respective clique followers for a
            specified time period until new cliques are formed. Amigo’s leader elections
            are based on <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/p2p/WifiP2pConfig">Android’s
                implementation</a> where nodes choose a "willingness" value (0-100), indicating their readiness to serve
            as a clique leader.
            The node in each given region with the highest “willingness" value is elected as leader.

        <p>
            Our new Dynamic Clique routing protocol achieves up to 95% or higher
            delivery rates while sending far fewer messages than flooding-based protocols
            over the course of our simulations. This difference ranges from ∼2× to ∼50×.
            In other words, our simulations show that dynamic clique routing can achieve
            similar levels of message delivery at a fraction of the messages sent –
            important for smartphones, which are constrained by battery size and CPU capability,
            as well as for overall network stability.

        <h2>Realistically Evaluating Amigo</h2>
        <p>
            Amigo is designed for large-scale protest settings, and protesters often move in

                and organized ways.</a>
            To accurately capture the effectiveness of our both our CGKA
            and routing layers, we needed to realistically simulate real protest conditions.
            We needed to evaluate how well Amigo handled these conditions through metrics like end-to-end delivery
            rates.
            Through news articles, videos, photos, and <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UROUN37_gUqrDd4FYDFYXQAmYuXtsBAfaDLo47Im-Kk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9n9f9eiq3xhs">protest
                guides</a>
            we were able to identify common protester mobility patterns.
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Marches:</b> A march involves a group walking together in the same direction.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Human Chains:</b> A human chain entails a line of stationary people who pass materials
                from one end of the line to the other.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Gatherings:</b> In the Hong Kong protest guide, the authors state that protests can also
                take the form of “gatherings with a specific focus.” Examples of such gatherings are
                musical performances and communal art projects.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Blockades:</b> A blockade occurs when protesters prevent entrance to a given space, e.g.,
                anti-ELAB protesters blockaded the Cross-Harbor Tunnel to stop police from entering a university

            Using <a href="https://www.nsnam.org/">ns-3, a discrete event simulator,</a> we were able to transform these
            patterns into mobility models we
            could use to test the end-to-end delivery rates of chat and CGKA protocol messages in the presence of
            realistic
            movement patterns. This enabled us to discover compelling takeaways and areas for future work that prior
            research in this space failed to identify due to lower-fidelity simulations.
        </p>

        <h2>Takeaways and Future Work</h2>
        <p>
            Benchmarks of the Amigo CGKA showed the efficiency we desired. Running on a low-end budget smartphone,
            a protester would be able to process roughly 39 member removals, 62 key refreshes, or 7 member additions in
            one minute for a group size of 200 members.
            In a similar vein, our power consumption benchmarks showed that Amigo's CGKA would not unduly drain a
            phone's battery.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it came to end-to-end delivery rates for our novel Dynamic Clique routing protocol, our high-fidelity
            simulations showed that Amigo
            achieves 95% or higher rates on multiple mobility models while sending far fewer messages than traditional
            flooding approaches.
        </p>

        <p>
            The table below depicts how different routing protocols fared under different mobility models. This table
            shows the total message packets send under each message propogation strategy during the duration of our
            simulation. The green check indicates whether or not a consistent
            cryptographic group state was achieved by the end of the simulation. The values within parentheses are
            message delivery rates. It is interesting to note that in certain mobility models, <i>none</i> of the
            protocols fared very well. Additionally, in many of the mobility models, traditional flooding <i>did not</i>
            fare as well as we expected. This was surprising and leads us to an important takeaway.

            Future work in this space needs to more adequately consider the complexities of mesh networking. Prior work,
            and we too at the beginning of this journey,
            assumed that the majority of the work was in the cryptography. However, the cryptography is only as
            effective as the underlying mesh that supports it.
            <b>The reliability of the network impacts the reliability of key management.</b> Lower layer complexities
            like network collisions, exacerbated by densely-packed
            environments, and complex mobility patterns can lead to network conditions that make building secure
            communication tools over a mesh non-trival. There is still
            a lot of work to be done in designing mesh routing algorithmns that can be effective in large-scale Internet
            shutdown settings: designing tooling that can support large-scale realistic simulations,
            algorithms that adjust to network congestion, and protocols that are robust to movement patterns.
        </p>

        <h2>TL;DR</h2>
        <p>
            To keep it short and sweet:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Protesters living under authoritarian regimes require secure ways of communicating within groups
                during Internet shutdowns.
            </li>
            <li>
                Amigo combines a novel continous group key agreement protocol and a novel Dynamic Clique routing
                protocol
                to enable secure group communication over a mesh network.
            </li>
            <li>
                Our simulations and benchmarks show that while Amigo contributes a positive step forward in this space,
                more work needs to be done to solve the complexities of secure mesh communication in large-scale protest
                scenarios.
