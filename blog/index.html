        <p class=abstract>
            During large-scale protests, a repressive government will often disable the
            Internet to thwart communication between protesters. Smartphone mesh networks,
            which route messages over short-range, possibly ephemeral, radio connections between
            nearby phones, allow protesters to communicate without relying on centralized
            Internet infrastructure. Unfortunately, prior work on providing secure communication
            in Internet shutdown settings fails to adequately consider protester needs. Previous
            attempts fail to support efficient private group communication (a crucial requirement
            for protests), and evaluate their solutions in network environments which fail to
            accurately capture link churn, physical spectrum contention, and the mobility models
            found in realistic protest settings. In this paper, we introduce Amigo, a novel mesh
            messaging system which supports group communication through a decentralized
            approach to continuous key agreement, and forwards messages using a novel routing
            protocol. Amigo is uniquely designed to handle the challenges of ad-hoc routing
            scenarios, where dynamic network topologies and node mobility make achieving key
            agreement nontrivial. Our extensive simulations reveal the poor scalability of prior
            approaches, the benefits of Amigoâ€™s protest-specific optimizations, and the challenges
            that still must be solved to scale secure mesh networks to protests with thousands of
            participants.
