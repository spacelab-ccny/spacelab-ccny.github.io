        <h3>Practical Cybersecurity (EE 469)</h3>
        <i>Offered: <a href="https://tjo.is/teaching/cyb-fa25/"><em>Fall 2025</em></a> (as EE 59889)</i>
        <p class=abstract>
            A hands-on course in cybersecurity techniques for future practitioners. Students will gain an understanding
            of common security vulnerabilities and how to defend against them. The course emphasizes a learn-by-doing
            approach, where students actively engage with real-world attacks and countermeasures in a controlled
            environment. Topics covered include threat modeling, privilege escalation, software vulnerabilities, network
            monitoring, web application exploits, and emerging threats in cybersecurity. 3 credits, undergraduate.
        </p>
        <h3>Secure Systems Engineering (EE I7701)</h3>
        <i>Offered: <a href="https://tjo.is/teaching/sse-fa25/"><em>Fall 2025</em></a>, <a
                href="https://tjo.is/teaching/sse-fa24/"><em>Fall 2024</em></a>, <a
                href="https://tjo.is/teaching/sse-sp24/">Spring 2024</a></i>
        <p class=abstract>
            A first course in the design and implementation of secure and
            private systems. Attacks against low-level programming, secure
            software engineering practices, and the use of Rust to develop
            secure systems. Detailed study of important secure systems such as
            TLS, messaging, and anonymity networks. Side channels and back doors
            in security-sensitive systems. Advanced topics and case studies in
            secure systems engineering. The course will culminate in a final
            project where students will engineer a secure system for a chosen
            application. 3 credits, graduate.
        </p>
        <h3>Advanced Cybersecurity (EE 59803 and EE G7703)</h3>
        <i>Offered: <em><a href="https://tjo.is/teaching/advanced-sp26/">Spring 2026</a></em></i>
        <p class=abstract>
            This course provides a comprehensive overview of advanced topics in
            cybersecurity. Students will get an opportunity to engage with published research through
            reading and discussion. The course will cover both classic papers and recent results in systems
            security, network security, applied cryptography, and privacy. Concurrently with reading and
            evaluating research, groups of students will work on a novel security research project on a topic
            of their choosing. The course will culminate in a research symposium, with groups presenting
            their research findings to the class. 3 credits, undergraduate (EE 59803) and graduate (EE G7703).
